# Data-extraction-from-image

This notebook uses pytesseract (which is a wrapper around Google's tesseract OCR engine) to extract json data from an image of a scanned table.
I wrote this code as a first-implementation for an project-internship position I was applying with TCS-Limited.

Note: I noticed this code works best with opencv-python==4.1.2 and numpy==1.19.5
